                <p>Background: The mobile game industry is a competitive market, valued at $161 billion USD in 2024. Many games are based on bright, colorful animations to lure in users through microtransactions. Let’s Carve A Pumpkin wants to break away from the mold as a relaxing, choose your own adventure style indie game for users that just want a break from their daily struggles without being pressured to spend money.</p>
                <p>Problem: Let’s Carve A Pumpkin needed to build from the ground up a simple user interface fueled by a robust framework to support fluid gameplay. Less is more with this project so the user experience needs to be seamless.</p>
                <p>Process: I started by gathering the graphic materials such as colors, fonts, and assets. It was important to ensure the animations functioned as expected and the graphics lined up properly, regardless of how the player made their selections. I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make the game visually appealing and functional. </p>
                <p>Results: This project produced a simple, relaxing choose-your-own-adventure style indie mobile game that taps into a seasonal market using a trendy, alternate color palette for a recognizable holiday activity. Let’s Carve A Pumpkin is able to stand out against its competitors because of its low-stress appeal and niche audience. </p>
