                    The car dealership app was to create a cloud-deployed platform where users 
                    could browse cars,view dealer information, read reviews, and 
                    submit feedback through a modern, responsive interface.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project combines frontend interactivity with backend data 
                    management and cloud deployment. Users can log in or register,
                     search for dealers, view dealer profiles, and leave reviews.
                    The app provides a clean and responsive dashboard that adapts
                    across desktop and mobile devices.
                </p>
                <h3>Building A Car Dealership Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    I built the application from the ground up, covering both 
                    frontend and backend responsibilities. On the frontend,
                    I implemented React components for dealer listings, 
                    detail pages, and review submissions. I created 
                    authentication flows(login, logout, registration) with
                     form validation and design a responsive UI using Boostrap 
                     and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the backend, I built Django views and models to manage 
                    iventory data and integrated external APIs for dealer and 
                    review information. I also created a Node/Express microservice 
                    connected to MongoDB, which served dealership data to frontend.
                    This microservces approach ensured modularity and made the app 
                    easier to scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the application production-ready, I containerized each
                    service with Docker and Kubernetes deployment artifacts. I also
                     integrated GitHub Actions for continuous integration, ensuring
                     that new changes were linted and tested automatically before
                     deployment.<br><br>
                    Frontend: React, Bootstrap, Javascript(ES6)<br>
                    Backend: Django, Node.js/Express, MongoDB<br>
                    Cloud/DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Github Actions<br>
                    Version Control: Git, Github
                </p>
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                    The Car Dealership App reflects my ability to bring together
                     multiple technologies into a cohesive full-stack solution. 
                    Beyond technical implementation, it reflects real-world 
                    practices like CI/CD and cloud-native 
                    deployment. The project demonstrates not just coding skills, 
                    but also an understanding of how to deliver scalable, 
                    production-grade web applications.
