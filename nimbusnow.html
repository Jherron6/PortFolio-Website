                <p>Background: NimbusNow wants to create a simple, intuitive and reliable weather app that can be trusted for up-to-date and accurate weather reports as an alternative to default weather apps.</p>
                <p>Problem: A weather app requires use of APIs to source real-time weather data based on, either the userâ€™s location, or through search. NimbusNow needs an effective design to display the most important weather details on the screen in a single page. </p>
                <p>Process: I researched the designs, functions, and information provided by popular weather apps. Based on the concept of a simple, fluid, and natural-feeling app, I designed a simple, single page interface using intuitive and semantic icons and colors. I used the OpenWeather API and JavaScript to support queries for the weather at specific locations. The app also has light and dark mode functionality. </p>
                <p>Results: The result was an easy-to-use weather app that users were able to navigate with ease and receive accurate, real-time weather data. NimbusNow is useful for on-the-go users who just want the basics readily available and easy to access.</p>
