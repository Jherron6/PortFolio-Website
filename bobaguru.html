                <p>Background: Boba Guru is a small, local boba tea shop located in Plano, TX. Their goal is to bring people together through one thing everyone can enjoy: food, or in this case, boba tea. </p>
                <p>Problem: Boba tea shops have increased in popularity over the past 10 years, with prominent chains like Feng Cha and Kung Fu popping up in locations all over the US. Boba Guru needs to be able to stand out against its competitors and build trust with its community. </p>
                <p>Process: I started by breaking down the recognizable basic elements already present in Boba Guru’s brand identity and examined the most successful aspects of its existing website and social media. Using these materials, I developed a new website build with Javascript to handle mock contact form submissions and designed a responsive online menu. </p>
                <p>Results: The website gave Boba Guru a very noticeable and recognizable online presence that highlights their quality products. The single page style keeps the website at a manageable size that prioritizes the menu which is the number one reason for a potential customer to visit a restaurant’s website. </p>
